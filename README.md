# The Banner Weekly
The Banner Weekly is an online publication where all the articles are generated using Google Gemini. The site originally used GPT-2 because GPT-3 wasn't available to the public, due to the fear of misuse. Originally, this site was intended to inspire a dialogue about the online information we consume and the influence of presentation on perceived truth and credibility. Now the site is just a place for me to be creative and try out new things in live, full-stack environment.

## About
The article's headlines are 100% real and taken from trusted publications around the web. The articles are written by Google's Gemini. However, this may change depending on the availability/reliability of other models.
