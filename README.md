# The Ersatz Tribune
[The Ersatz Tribune](https://ersatz-tribune.herokuapp.com) is a an online publication where all the articles are generated using OpenAI's [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2). 

The Tribune's purpose is as an educational tool and a place for readers to examine the role of artifial intelligence in online news and disinformation. It is a concrete example of how mass-produced, computer-generated content can be dressed up to mimic the look and feel of traditional publications. Hopefully, it will inspire a dialogue about the online information we consume and the influence of Presentation on perceived truth and credibility.

## About
The article's headlines are 100% real and taken from trusted publications around the web. Through the Tribune's admin portal, the headlines are seeded to GPT-2 through an API call to [OpenAI's text-generator](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator). However, this may change depending on the availability/reliability of other models. 

Since the model was trained on a dataset from the past, there are many oudated 'facts' generated by the AI. For example, incorrectly naming the President of the United States or current year. To maintain some level of believability, there is a [tool on the admin portal](https://github.com/MScottWold/ai_news/blob/master/app/javascript/packs/admin_portal.js) for swapping outdated names, years, etc. Otherwise, the text is all computer generated.
