      <p class="question">These articles are nonesense.</p>
      <p>If you haven't noticed already, the articles here don't make a ton of sense. That's because the were written by the AI developed by OpenAI, GPT-2</p>
      <p>

      <p>
      <p>Currently, this website makes use of DeepAI's Text Generation API that leverages GPT-2</p>

      <p class="question">Is everything written by GPT-2?</p>
      <p>No, the headlines are copied from or heavily based on current headlines from publications around the world. The text generation is based on the given headline.</p>
      <p>Additionally, since the AI was trained on a data set that was gathered some time ago, GPT-2's "understanding" isn't up to date with certain current facts. On the admin portal for this site, I added a tool that helps me swap outdated people/roles/years with the current ones. For example, political offices have new office holders, sports teams have new players, and "last year" isn't still 2012.</p>
      <p class="question">Why make a site like this? Aren't you worried about the spread of disinformation?</p>
      <p>The fear of spreading disinformation is precisely why I made this site. When discussing the potential abuse potential of AI generated content, it can be challenging to communicate exactly what that means. Conversations on the topic can veer into the hypothetical or even the abstract. Building a site like this is a way to effectively communicate what the AI is capable of using concrete examples. Furthermore, the AI used to generate these articles isn't even the most advanced that OpenAI has developed. They recently released a much more powerful version, GPT-3, which can simulate much better, more coherent text. Knowing there are more powerful text generation models helps provide necessary context when contemplating what the future will look like.</p>
      <p class="question">Is there a real fear that AI-generated "news" articles will spread with negative consequences?</p>
      <p>Yes and no, the AI-generated articles themselves aren't likely to cause problems; at least, not these ones. Rather, a malicious person writing a targeted article would have a much larger impact than randomly generated articles. However, the ability of these models to produce vast quantities of content can serve as a sort of "padding" to an otherwise lonely article. This padding could give the impression of legitimacy to an otherwise lonely article.</p>
      <p>Consider this: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://openai.com/blog/tags/gpt-2/">"70% of Facebook users only read the headline of science stories before commenting" and "59 percent of links shared on social media have never actually been clicked"</a>.</p>
      <p>If the majority aren't reading the articles themselves, how many do you think will investigate the trustworthiness of the website by reading other articles they publish? Simply seeing the "padding" around the article is enough to get past most people's initial "is this fake?"-filter.</p>
      <p>Lastly, text is just the tip of the iceberg. What would happen if the comments on these articles were generated by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655212/reddit-ai-bots-gpt2-openai-text-artificial-intelligence-subreddit">conversational AI</a>? What if in addition to usernames, you saw <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/21/science/artificial-intelligence-fake-people-faces.html">the faces of the "people" making the comments</a>? As a casual reader, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167214562761">what effect would that have</a>?</p>
      <p>It's true, you don't need AI-generate content to create fake news websites like this, it just makes it significantly easier.</p>
