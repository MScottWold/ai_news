      <p class="question">These articles are nonesense</p>
      <p>If you haven't noticed already, the articles here don't make a ton of sense. That's because the were written by the AI developed by OpenAI, GPT-2</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Currently, this website makes use of DeepAI's Text Generation API that leverages GPT-2</p>

      <p class="question">Is everything written by GPT-2?</p>
      <p>No, the headlines are copied from or heavily based on recent headlines from publications around the world. The text generation is based on the headline supplied to it.</p>
      <p>Additionally, since the AI was trained on a data set that was gathered some time ago, GPT-2's "understanding" isn't up to date with certain current facts. The Tribune uses an admin tool to swap outdated people/roles/years with the current ones. For example, political offices have new office holders, sports teams have new players, etc.</p>
      <p class="question">Why make a site like this?</p>
      <p>The fear of proliferating disinformation is why The Ersatz Tribune was made. When discussing the abuse potential of AI generated content, it can be challenging to communicate exactly what that means. Conversations on the topic can veer into the hypothetical and even the abstract. Building this site is a way to effectively communicate what the AI is capable of by using concrete examples.</p>
      <p>The AI used to generate these articles isn't even the most advanced that OpenAI have developed. They recently released a more powerful version, GPT-3, which simulates better, more coherent text. Knowing there are more powerful text generation models helps provide necessary context when contemplating what the future of disinformation could look like.</p>
      <p class="question">Is there a real fear that AI-generated "news" articles will spread with negative consequences?</p>
      <p>Yes and no, the content of the AI-generated articles isn't likely to cause problems; at least, not these articles. Rather, a malicious person writing a targeted article could have a much larger impact than a randomly generated one. However, the ability of these models to produce vast quantities of content can serve as a sort of "padding" to such an article. This padding could give the impression of legitimacy to an otherwise lonely article.</p>
      <p>Consider this: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://openai.com/blog/tags/gpt-2/">"70% of Facebook users only read the headline of science stories before commenting" and "59 percent of links shared on social media have never actually been clicked"</a>.</p>
      <p>If the majority of people aren't reading the actual articles, how many will take additional steps to vet the trustworthiness of the website by reading other articles on the site? Simply seeing convincing "padding" around the article is enough to pass most people's initial "is this fake?"-filter.</p>
      <p>Lastly, text is just the tip of the iceberg. What would happen if the comments on these articles were generated by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655212/reddit-ai-bots-gpt2-openai-text-artificial-intelligence-subreddit">conversational AI</a>? What if in addition to usernames, you saw <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/21/science/artificial-intelligence-fake-people-faces.html">the faces of the "people" making the comments</a>? As a casual reader, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167214562761">what effect would that have</a>?</p>
      <p>You don't need AI-generate content to create fake news websites like this one, it just makes it significantly easier.</p>
